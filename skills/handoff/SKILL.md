name: handoff
description: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document for another agent to pick up. Use when context is running low or you want a fresh session to continue the work. Based on mattpocock/skills (MIT).
argument-hint: "What will the next session be used for?"
---

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue
the work. Save it to the OS temporary directory — not the current workspace.

Include a "suggested skills" section that names the skills the next agent should invoke.

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts (PRDs, plans, ADRs, issues,
commits, diffs). Reference them by path or URL instead.

Redact any sensitive information — API keys, passwords, tokens, or personally identifiable
information.

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus
on and tailor the doc accordingly.
